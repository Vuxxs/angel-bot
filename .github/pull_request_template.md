# Contributing to Angel Bot

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MPL-2.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MPL-2.0 License](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Angel-Bot/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Angel-Bot/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's an example of a bug report:

> **Short and descriptive example bug report title**
> 
> **A summary of the issue and the environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps to reproduce.**
> 
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> **Any error messages that you received**
> 
> **What you expected would happen**
>
> **What actually happens**
>
> Notes: Possibly include other information that might be useful. Example: Operating system version, Node.js version, etc.

**Use a Consistent Coding Style**
We're using Prettier for code formatting. Run `npm run format` before committing your code.
